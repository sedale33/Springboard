    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "Racial diversity exist for the purpose of cultural enhancement however it has become a sore point in the US society. This research seeks to evalute the policies of companies as it relates to racial diversity in the workplace. A two sample t-test was performed to determine if the differecne in the number of callbacks for white-sounding names compared to black-sounding names was statistically significant. A p-value of 3.94e-5 reveals that there is a signficant difference between the callbacks received by each group, an indication of racial discrimination in the workplace. "

It is difficult to determine how education influence callback due to the fact that I'm ignorant of what level of education each numeral (0-4) represent. The analysis (mean/average) below takes into consideration race, race-years of experience, gender-years of experience and race-gender-years of experience relationships. The significants of each as not be evaluated however just by eyeballing the averages, in order for a black female to receive a callback they are required to have a lot more experience than the other groups.
